landmark volume in scientific writing, with more than nine million copies in forty languages sold worldwide. That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout.</td>\n","      <td>4.18</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction, Audiobook, Classics]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>Permanent Record</td>\n","      <td>Edward Snowden</td>\n","      <td>Edward Snowden, the man who risked everything to expose the US government’s system of mass surveillance, reveals for the first time the story of his life, including how he helped to build that system and what motivated him to try to bring it down.In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, Permanent Record is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online—a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet’s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, Permanent Record is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.</td>\n","      <td>4.31</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction, Audiobook]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>8</th>\n","      <td>8</td>\n","      <td>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</td>\n","      <td>Carlo Rovelli</td>\n","      <td>All the beauty of modern physics in fewer than a hundred pages.This is a book about the joy of discovery.

Yet one day, he began to consider how very little he knew about the ordinary things of life as he found it in that comfortable home. To remedy this, he formed the idea of journeying about his house from room to room to “write a history of the world without leaving home.” The bathroom provides the occasion for a history of hygiene; the bedroom, sex, death, and sleep; the kitchen, nutrition and the spice trade; and so on, as Bryson shows how each has figured in the evolution of private life. Whatever happens in the world, he demonstrates, ends up in our house, in the paint and the pipes and the pillows and every item of furniture.(front flap)</td>\n","      <td>3.97</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction, Audiobook, Historical, Cultural]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>16</th>\n","      <td>16</td>\n","      <td>Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents</td>\n","      <td>Isabel Wilkerson</td>\n","      <td>The Pulitzer Prize–winning, bestselling author of The Warmth of Other Suns examines the unspoken caste system that has shaped America and shows how our lives today are still defined by a hierarchy of human divisions.“As we go about our daily lives, caste is the wordless usher in a darkened theater, flashlight cast down in the aisles, guiding us to our assigned seats for a performance. The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power—which groups have it and which do not.”In this brilliant book, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a masterful portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings.Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people’s lives and behavior and the nation’s fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people—including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball’s Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others—she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity.</td>\n","      <td>4.59</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction, Audiobook, Cultural]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>17</th>\n","      <td>17</td>\n","      <td>Frankenstein: The 1818 Text</td>\n","      <td>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</td>\n","      <td>Mary Shelley's seminal novel of the scientist whose creation becomes a monsterThis edition is the original 1818 text, which preserves the hard-hitting and politically charged aspects of Shelley's original writing, as well as her unflinching wit and strong female voice.

Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nudge is about how we make these choices and how we can make better ones. Using dozens of eye-opening examples and drawing on decades of behavioral science research, Nobel Prize winner Richard H. Thaler and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein show that no choice is ever presented to us in a neutral way, and that we are all susceptible to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions. But by knowing how people think, we can use sensible “choice architecture” to nudge people toward the best decisions for ourselves, our families, and our society, without restricting our freedom of choice.</td>\n","      <td>3.84</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>23</th>\n","      <td>23</td>\n","      <td>The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom</td>\n","      <td>Jonathan Haidt</td>\n","      <td>In his widely praised book, award-winning psychologist Jonathan Haidt examines the world’s philosophical wisdom through the lens of psychological science, showing how a deeper understanding of enduring maxims-like Do unto others as you would have others do unto you, or What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger-can enrich and even transform our lives.</td>\n","      <td>4.11</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction, Audiobook]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>27</th>\n","      <td>27</td>\n","      <td>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</td>\n","      <td>Mark Haddon</td>\n","      <td>Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057.

What follows makes for a novel that is funny, poignant and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing are a mind that perceives the world entirely literally.</td>\n","      <td>3.88</td>\n","      <td>[Adult Fiction, Mystery, Literature, Classics, Contemporary, Fiction, Novels]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>39</th>\n","      <td>39</td>\n","      <td>Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know About the People We Don’t Know</td>\n","      <td>Malcolm Gladwell</td>\n","      <td>Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Outliers, offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers -- and why they often go wrong.How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true?While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's \"Hell You Talmbout.\"Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.</td>\n","      <td>4.04</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction, Audiobook, Adult]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>40</th>\n","      <td>40</td>\n","      <td>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany</td>\n","      <td>William L.

But those 12 years contained some of the most catastrophic events Western civilization has ever known.No other powerful empire ever bequeathed such mountains of evidence about its birth and destruction as the Third Reich. When the bitter war was over, and before the Nazis could destroy their files, the Allied demand for unconditional surrender produced an almost hour-by-hour record of the nightmare empire built by Adolph Hitler. This record included the testimony of Nazi leaders and of concentration camp inmates, the diaries of officials, transcripts of secret conferences, army orders, private letters—all the vast paperwork behind Hitler's drive to conquer the world.The famed foreign correspondent and historian William L. Shirer, who had watched and reported on the Nazis since 1925, spent five and a half years sifting through this massive documentation. The result is a monumental study that has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of one of the most frightening chapters in the history of mankind.This worldwide bestseller has been acclaimed as the definitive book on Nazi Germany; it is a classic work.The accounts of how the United States got involved and how Hitler used Mussolini and Japan are astonishing, and the coverage of the war-from Germany's early successes to her eventual defeat-is must reading</td>\n","      <td>4.16</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction, Historical, Cultural]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>44</th>\n","      <td>44</td>\n","      <td>Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die</td>\n","      <td>Chip Heath</td>\n","      <td>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - The instant classic about why some ideas thrive, why others die, and how to improve your idea's chances--essential reading in the \"fake news\" era.Mark Twain once observed, \"A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.\" His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus news stories circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas--entrepreneurs, teachers, politicians, and journalists--struggle to make them \"stick.\"In Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the human scale principle, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating curiosity gaps. Along the way, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds--from the infamous \"kidney theft ring\" hoax to a coach's lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony--draw their power from the same six traits.Made to Stick will transform the way you communicate. It's a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice.Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, Made to Stick shows us the vital principles of winning ideas--and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.</td>\n","      <td>3.96</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>48</th>\n","      <td>48</td>\n","      <td>Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams</td>\n","      <td>Matthew Walker</td>\n","      <td>Neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker provides a revolutionary exploration of sleep, examining how it affects every aspect of our physical and mental well-being.

In California, wildfires now rage year-round, destroying thousands of homes. Across the US, \"500-year\" storms pummel communities month after month, and floods displace tens of millions annually.This is only a preview of the changes to come. And they are coming fast. Without a revolution in how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth could become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century.In his travelogue of our near future, David Wallace-Wells brings into stark relief the climate troubles that await--food shortages, refugee emergencies, and other crises that will reshape the globe. But the world will be remade by warming in more profound ways as well, transforming our politics, our culture, our relationship to technology, and our sense of history. It will be all-encompassing, shaping and distorting nearly every aspect of human life as it is lived today.Like An Inconvenient Truth and Silent Spring before it, The Uninhabitable Earth is both a meditation on the devastation we have brought upon ourselves and an impassioned call to action.

At the heart of his theory, known as logotherapy, is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful.

With Humankind, he brings that mentality to bear against one of our most entrenched ideas: namely, that human beings are by nature selfish and self-interested.By providing a new historical perspective of the last 200,000 years of human history, Bregman sets out to prove that we are in fact evolutionarily wired for cooperation rather than competition, and that our instinct to trust each other has a firm evolutionary basis going back to the beginning of Homo sapiens. Bregman systematically debunks our understanding of the Milgram electrical-shock experiment, the Zimbardo prison experiment, and the Kitty Genovese \"bystander effect.\"In place of these, he offers little-known true stories: the tale of twin brothers on opposing sides of apartheid in South Africa who came together with Nelson Mandela to create peace; a group of six shipwrecked children who survived for a year and a half on a deserted island by working together; a study done after World War II that found that as few as 15% of American soldiers were actually capable of firing at the enemy.The ultimate goal of Humankind is to demonstrate that while neither capitalism nor communism has on its own been proven to be a workable social system, there is a third option: giving \"citizens and professionals the means (left) to make their own choices (right).\" Reorienting our thinking toward positive and high expectations of our fellow man, Bregman argues, will reap lasting success. Bregman presents this idea with his signature wit and frankness, once again making history, social science and economic theory accessible and enjoyable for lay readers.</td>\n","      <td>4.33</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction, Audiobook]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>71</th>\n","      <td>71</td>\n","      <td>The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals</td>\n","      <td>Michael Pollan</td>\n","      <td>What should we have for dinner? For omnivore's like ourselves, this simple question has always posed a dilemma: When you can eat just about anything nature (or the supermarket) has to offer, deciding what you should eat will inevitably stir anxiety, especially when some of the foods on offer might shorten your life. Today, buffeted by one food fad after another, America is suffering from what can only be described as a national eating disorder. The omnivore's dilemma has returned with a vengeance, as the cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet confronts us with a bewildering and treacherous food landscape. What's at stake in our eating choices is not only our own and our children's health, but the health of the environment that sustains life on earth.The Omnivore's Dilemma is a groundbreaking book in which one of America's most fascinating, original, and elegant writers turns his own omnivorous mind to the seemingly straightforward question of what we should have for dinner. The question has confronted us since man discovered fire, but, according to Michael Pollan, the bestselling author of The Botany of Desire, how we answer it today, ath the dawn of the twenty-first century, may well determine our very survival as a species. Should we eat a fast-food hamburger? Something organic&amp;gt; Or perhaps something we hunt, gather or grow ourselves?To find out, Pollan follows each of the food chains that sustain us--industrial food, organic or alternative food, and food we forage ourselves--from the source to a final meal, and in the process develops a definitive account of the American way of eating. His absorbing narrative takes us from Iowa cornfields to food laboratories, from feedlots and fast-food restaurants to organic farms and hunting grounds, always emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the handful of plant and animal species we depend on. Each time Pollan sits down to a meal, he deploys his unique blend of personal and investigative journalism to trace the origins of everything consumed, revealing what we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods and flavors reflects our evolutionary inheritance.The surprising answers Pollan offers to the simple question posed by this book have profound political, economic, psychological, and even mortal implications for all of us. Ultimately, this is a book as much about visionary solutions as it is about problems, and Pollan contends that, when it comes to food, doing the right thing often turns out to be the tastiest thing an eater can do. Beautifully written and thrillingly argued, The Omnivore's Dilemma promises to change the way we think about the politics and pleasure of eating. For anyone who reads it, dinner will never again look, or taste, quite the same.--jacket</td>\n","      <td>4.16</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction, Audiobook]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["    book_id  ...                                                                         genres\n","64       64  ...

We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder: Wasn’t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontent—even from ourselves.For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voice—the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the world’s expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living.Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member’s ability to bring her full self to the table. And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She Is.Untamed shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: The braver we are, the luckier we get.</td>\n","      <td>4.11</td>\n","      <td>[Nonfiction, Audiobook, Adult]</td>\n","      <td>407</td>\n","      <td>revealing powerful memoir yet beloved activist speaker bestselling author love warrior carry on warrior explores joy peace discover stop striving meet expectations world start trusting voice deep within us this find yourself there voice longing inside woman strive mightily good good partners daughters mothers employees friends hope striving make us feel alive instead leaves us feeling weary stuck overwhelmed underwhelmed look lives wonder wasnt supposed beautiful this quickly silence question telling grateful hiding discontenteven ourselves for many years glennon doyle denied discontent then speaking conference looked woman across room fell instantly love three words flooded mind is first glennon assumed words came high soon realized come within voicethe one buried beneath decades numbing addictions cultural conditioning institutional allegiances voice girl world told be glennon decided quit abandoning instead abandon worlds expectations her quit good could free quit pleasing started living soulful uproarious forceful tender untamed intimate memoir galvanizing wake up call story one woman learned responsible mother one slowly dies children one shows fully live story navigating divorce forming new blended family discovering brokenness wholeness family depends structure members ability bring full self table story us begin trust enough set boundaries make peace bodies honor anger heartbreak unleash truest wildest instincts become women finally look say is untamed shows us brave glennon insists braver are luckier get</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>835</th>\n","      <td>835</td>\n","      <td>Dark Matter</td>\n","      <td>Blake Crouch</td>\n","      <td>Jason Dessen is walking home through the chilly Chicago streets one night, looking forward to a quiet evening in front of the fireplace with his wife, Daniela, and their son, Charlie—when his reality shatters.- - -'Are you happy in your life?'Those are the last words Jason Dessen hears before the masked abductor knocks him unconscious.

A tiny community nestled deep in the forest, it is slowly losing ground to the ever encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink, built generations ago by the working men who founded this town. And in that ice rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today. Their junior ice hockey team is about to compete in the national semi-finals, and they actually have a shot at winning. All the hopes and dreams of this place now rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenage boys.Being responsible for the hopes of an entire town is a heavy burden, and the semi-final match is the catalyst for a violent act that will leave a young girl traumatized and a town in turmoil. Accusations are made and, like ripples on a pond, they travel through all of Beartown, leaving no resident unaffected.Beartown explores the hopes that bring a small community together, the secrets that tear it apart, and the courage it takes for an individual to go against the grain.

Massie</td>\n","      <td>Pulitzer Prize winner Massie offers the tale of a princess who went to Russia at 14 and became one of the most powerful women in history. Born into minor German nobility, she transformed herself into an empress by sheer determination. Possessing a brilliant, curious mind, she devoured the works of Enlightenment philosophers, and reaching the throne, tried using their principles to rule the vast, backward empire. She knew or corresponded with notable figures of her time: Voltaire, Diderot, Frederick the Great, Maria Theresa of Austria, Marie Antoinette &amp;amp; John Paul Jones. Wanting to be the “benevolent despot” Montesquieu idealized, she contended with the deeply ingrained realities of Russian life, including serfdom. She persevered, and for 34 years the government, foreign policy, cultural development and welfare of the Russian people were in her hands. She dealt with domestic rebellion, wars &amp;amp; the tides of political change and violence inspired by the French Revolution. Her reputation depended on the perspective of the speaker. She was praised by Voltaire as like the classical philosophers. She was condemned by enemies, mostly foreign, as “the Messalina of the north.” Her family, friends, ministers, generals, lovers and enemies are vividly described. These included her ambitious, scheming mother; her weak, bullying husband, Peter (who left her sexually untouched for nine years after their marriage); her unhappy son &amp;amp; heir, Paul; her beloved grandchildren; and her favorites—the young men from whom she sought companionship and the recapture of youth as well as sex. Here, too, is Gregory Potemkin, her most significant lover &amp;amp; possible husband, with whom she shared a correspondence of love &amp;amp; separation, followed by 17 years of unparalleled mutual achievement. All the qualities that Massie brought to Nicholas &amp;amp; Alexandra and Peter the Great are present: historical accuracy, deep understanding, felicity of style, mastery of detail, ability to shatter myth &amp;amp; a genius for finding and expressing a human drama.</td>\n","      <td>3.91</td>\n","      <td>[Cultural, Literature, Nonfiction, Audiobook, Historical]</td>\n","      <td>315</td>\n","      <td>pulitzer prize winner massie offers tale princess went russia 14 became one powerful women history born minor german nobility transformed empress sheer determination possessing brilliant curious mind devoured works enlightenment philosophers reaching throne tried using principles rule vast backward empire knew corresponded notable figures time voltaire diderot frederick great maria theresa austria marie antoinette amp john paul jones wanting benevolent despot montesquieu idealized contended deeply ingrained realities russian life including serfdom persevered 34 years government foreign policy cultural development welfare russian people hands dealt domestic rebellion wars amp tides political change violence inspired french revolution reputation depended perspective speaker praised voltaire like classical philosophers condemned enemies mostly foreign messalina north family friends ministers generals lovers enemies vividly described included ambitious scheming mother weak bullying husband peter who left sexually untouched nine years marriage unhappy son amp heir paul beloved grandchildren favoritesthe young men sought companionship recapture youth well sex here too gregory potemkin significant lover amp possible husband shared correspondence love amp separation followed 17 years unparalleled mutual achievement qualities massie brought nicholas amp alexandra peter great present historical accuracy deep understanding felicity style mastery detail ability shatter myth amp genius finding expressing human drama</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2120</th>\n","      <td>2120</td>\n","      <td>The Tales of Beedle the Bard</td>\n","      <td>J.K.
